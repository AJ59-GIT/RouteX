PROJECT: OMNIROUTE INDIA - SMART MaaS AGGREGATOR
================================================================================

1. OVERVIEW
OmniRoute India is a world-class Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) aggregator 
specifically engineered for the complex transit landscape of Indian Metro cities.
It connects public transport (Metro, Local Trains, Buses) with private providers
(Ola, Uber, Rapido) and community-driven options (Carpooling, Bike-sharing).

2. CORE FEATURES
- Multimodal Smart Routing: AI-driven pathfinding that mixes transit modes.
- Magic Mode (NLP): Natural language processing to parse complex travel queries.
- Safety Shield: Integrated SOS, live location sharing, and emergency contacts.
- Real-time Traffic Feeds: Dynamic route adjustment based on live city congestion.
- Eco-Impact Dashboard: Real-time CO2 savings tracking and community leaderboard.
- PWA Architecture: Offline booking fallback, service worker caching, and 
  low-bandwidth optimization.
- Smart Insights: Predictive analytics on crowd levels, price surges, and 
  optimal departure times.

3. TECHNICAL STACK
- UI Framework: React 19.0 (ES Modules via ESM.sh)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (Modern Utility-First)
- Animations: Framer Motion (Smooth gesture-based transitions)
- AI Engine: Google Gemini 2.5/3.0 API (@google/genai)
- State Management: React Context API + Custom Hooks
- Type Safety: TypeScript + Zod (Runtime Schema Validation)
- Persistence: LocalStorage + Storage Service Layer (Cloud-ready)
- Reliability: Service Workers (sw.js) + Robust Error Boundaries

4. COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS (Vs. OLA, UBER, RAPIDO)
While market leaders focus on single-provider fulfillment, OmniRoute bridges 
the gap with:
- Aggregation: Compare Ola, Uber, and Rapido prices on one screen.
- Multimodal: Combines an Auto/Cab with the Metro to bypass "Gridlock" traffic.
- Public Transit Integration: Real-time Metro/Local Train schedules.
- Sustainability: Explicit focus on carbon footprint vs. just speed/cost.

5. MISSING ENTERPRISE FUNCTIONS (FUTURE ROADMAP)
- Direct API Booking: Moving from deep-linking to in-app transactional APIs.
- Driver Hub: Direct two-way communication with the assigned vehicle.
- Safety SOS Hub: Direct 100/102 integration with local police dispatch.
- Multi-stop Itineraries: Complex routing for errands and carpooling pick-ups.

6. DESIGN PRINCIPLES
- Aesthetics: Warm palette (Slate Gray & Coral) for an approachable feel.
- Accessibility: High-contrast mode, biometric unlock, and screen-reader support.
- Performance: Stale-while-revalidate caching and skeleton loading states.
